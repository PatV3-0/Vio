			<div id="aboutComic">
				<p class="synopsis">Red Point started as a series of rough sketches and experimentation with styles and colours. Initially, Nate, the main character, was going to be a climbing instructor stranded in the woods with a school group. It was going to be a gritty tale of survival in wild and unexplored teritory.</p>
				<p class="synopsis">This all changed in August 2022 when we were asked: "If you character had a superpower, what would it be?". Very quickly the idea of Nate with glowing eyes and ghostly ribs for armor took shape. By the time that Jamie's concept and their relationship came up, Nate had become a benevolent ghost intent on helping someone to get their life back together.</p>

				<h1>Nothing exists in a vaccuum</h1>

			<div id="aboutAuthor">
				<p class="abt">As is with every comic, or story for that matter, things tend to have a mind of their own. Nate was never going to exist in a vaccuum, so when Jamie came along, bringing some life to the abandoned cottage, things got interesting.</p>
				<p class="abt">With a human in a house full of ghosts, there is bound to be some mischief and a few culture shocks. Since the author likes to binge horror, naturally, a murderous ghost lady would come into being. Thus, Viola, the antagonist was born. Vengeful and possessive, she very quickly threatens Jamie's life when her haunt is disturbed.</p>

				<h1>Every story needs conflict</h1>
			</div>
			<div id="comic2">

			</div>
			<div id="aboutComic">
				<p class="synopsis">Without conflict, the world would be quite boring. So naturally Nate and Jamie must defend themselves against Viola. But of course, no artist is exempt. During the creation of the last panels, the author's stylus gave the ghost and they had a challenge of their own to overcome.</p>

				<p class="abt" style="text-align: center;">Of course things can't just end there. That'd be cruel.</p>
				<p class="abt" style="text-align: center;">Since the completion of the original comic, Red Point has evolved. First, we created an interactive trailer readers could play through to learn more about the comic. Then we made a motion comic complete with sound and animated text. And because we don't want them to gather dust, we put them here for you to find!</p>
				<p class="abt" style="text-align: center;">They can be found at the links below. Go wild!</p>

				<p class="synopsis">Patterson Rainbird-Webb is an aspiring artist and developer currently studying their second degree.</p>
				<p class="synopsis">They listen to heavy metal and watch horror, but they also have a soft spot for mustelids, growing things and their pet cat Brylee whom everyone refers to as "The Cheese".

				<p class="synopsis">They hope that one day they can use all of the hobies they have collected to make the world a cooler and more accessible place and their current goal is to make video games that people with photosensitive epilepsy can play.</p>
